# TokenGas - Revolutionizing ERC-20 Transactions for a Seamless Binance Smart Chain Experience

## Description:

Welcome to TokenGas, a groundbreaking project engineered to elevate the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem. Designed with a commitment to simplicity and efficiency, TokenGas empowers users to seamlessly conduct ERC-20 transactions and cover gas fees directly with ERC-20 tokens, transforming the BSC experience.

This was born out of the challenge we faced after receiving erc20 for a project we built but we could not transfer or swap the token as we did not have native tokens and hence can‚Äôt send it to any exchange.

## üåê TokenGas Integration for BSC Excellence:

TokenGas introduces a seamless integration for BSC, enabling users (EOA) to pay gas fees directly in ERC-20 tokens. This is all made possible by ERC20 Permit feature which allows approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in EIP-2612. Say goodbye to the complexities of managing different tokens and embrace a streamlined BSC transaction process.

## üî• How TokenGas Elevates BSC Transactions:

- **The User (EOA):**
  - BSC users, rejoice! TokenGas allows you to effortlessly execute ERC-20 transfers and swaps while paying gas fees with your ERC-20 tokens, enhancing the overall BSC transaction experience.
- **The Liquidity Provider:**
  - Native token (BNB) holders become liquidity providers by contributing to a Liquidity pool (ERC4626 Vault). These providers cover gas fees and earn transaction costs in the user-provided token, actively contributing to the BSC ecosystem.
- **The Executors:**
  - Anyone can be an executor within TokenGas. Facilitate off-chain signatures, initially covering transaction fees. Later, receive reimbursement plus a small fee from the protocol, ensuring the smooth operation of BSC transactions.
